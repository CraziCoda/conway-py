# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a simulation that shows how groups of cells on a grid can change over time. Simple rules determine this, leading to interesting and complex patterns.

## Rules

1. **Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive.**
2. **Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies (underpopulation).**
3. **Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies (overpopulation).**
4. **Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction).**

## Instructions

1. **Start the Simulation:**
   - Hit any key to continue.

2. **Editing the Grid:**
   - Click cells to activate or deactivate them.
   - Press `Enter` to start the game.

3. **Game Controls:**
   - Use `Enter` to pause and edit the game.
   - Press `Enter` again to continue the simulation.
   - Use `Arrow Up` to zoom in.
   - Use `Arrow Down` to zoom out.
   - Press `Esc` to clear the screen.

Enjoy exploring the fascinating patterns that emerge in Conway's Game of Life!
